## nfl_custom_aggs

Built on the nfl-data-py module, the nfl_custom_agg functions allow you to import aggregated statistics for individual offensive players at the level of detail you want (season, week, half, quarter, or drive). You can also choose to import the raw play-by-play data with the enrichments used to create the aggregations (fantasy data, indiivudal play lineups, etc.).
